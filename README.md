# AI Web Scraper  

This project is a Python-based web scraper that uses Selenium for gathering content from websites and LLaMA (via Ollama) to process the scraped data. The AI model runs locally on your computer, ensuring data privacy while providing meaningful insights from the content you scrape.  

## Features  

- **Web Scraping**: Automates the process of collecting content from websites.  
- **Local AI Model**: Uses LLaMA to analyze and summarize the scraped content right on your machine.  
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the scraper to work with different websites and content needs.  

## Tools and Libraries  

- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.  
- **Selenium**: Handles browser automation and scraping.  
- **Ollama LLaMA**: Processes the scraped content with natural language understanding.  
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML content (optional, depending on your use case).  
 

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.8 or later installed on your machine.  
- A browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver) compatible with your browser version.  
- LLaMA set up locally via Ollama. Follow the [Ollama installation guide](https://www.ollama.ai/) for instructions.
